# PowershellManagementScripts
Repository of custom Powershell scripts useful for managing MTD servers.

##Notes
Most of these scripts will use [Powershell Remoting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849694.aspx). You should be able to enable it on a server by running the following command at an administrative Powershell Command Prompt.
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting â€“force
```

These scripts will require you to enable unsigned script execution. You can do so by running the following command at an administrative Powershell Command Prompt.
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
```
