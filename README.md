# PowerShell Management Scripts

Repository of custom PowerShell scripts useful for managing MTD servers.

## Notes

### Prerequisites

Most of these scripts will use
[PowerShell Remoting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849694.aspx).
You should enable it on any remote servers you plan on interacting with
by running the following command at an administrative PowerShell Command Prompt.

Scripts that interact with Office 365 must be run in [Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/mfa-connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting â€“force
```

These scripts will require you to enable unsigned script execution. You can do so by running the following command at an administrative PowerShell Command Prompt.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
```

### Installing Modules

Run `Install.ps1` or follow the instructions bellow to install manually.

1. Create a directory called `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
2. Open PowerShell and make sure the directory is in your path (`$env:PSModulePath`).
3. Close Powershel and copy the `MtdModules` directory into ``.
4. Reopen PowerShell and verify that the modules are properly installed by typing running the command `Get-Command -Module MtdModules`
5. To use the modules run the command `Import-Module MtdModules`.
